Considering I'll be working in the field of "extremes attribution" for at least the next few years, I thought it may be worth my while communicating some of what I do on a public platform. I'll attempt to communicate science using non-academic jargon and by keeping my posts entertaining (by using images and analogies for example)! Don't hesitate to comment, critique, or if there's anything you're not getting - ask a question in the box way below.

So what does "extremes attribution" actually mean? Suppose a heatwave or flooding event has recently occurred. The extremes attribution community is often faced with answering the question: "are humans to blame for causing this weather event?" or worded differently: "did the greenhouse-gases emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution cause this weather event?" It is in fact impossible to answer this question since the event could have (in most cases) still occurred had we never changed the chemistry of the atmosphere. Let me explain with an analogy.

If a smoker is diagnosed with lung cancer, we cannot immediately blame the act of smoking on causing the disease: smoking may be thought to be a credible cause - but a cigarette manufacturer would be the first to point out that there are numerous other causes of lung cancer. Because there is more than one cause, we cannot say smoking "did" or "didn't" cause your cancer: we can only describe the relevant contributions from all causes in terms of probability. An event attribution study was performed to find out the degree by which smoking increases your chances of contracting cancer: it distinguished the influence of one cause from all other possible causes. Thanks to the study, we now know that smoking is responsible for 80-90% of all lung cancer cases. It quantitatively clarified what was previously prone to speculation. With studies attributing the risk of lung cancer to the act of smoking, governments could implement policy and public awareness campaigns based on these attribution statements.

With the help of example code, learn how to: read in netCDF files; generate maps; calculate area-weighted averages; plot time series; write list-comprehensions (i.e. more compact loops); and use CDO within Python using the CDO Python module.
