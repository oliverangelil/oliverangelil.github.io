I work as a data scientist at Credit Suisse in Zurich, but took two months unpaid leave in Rwanda, to volunteer at a data science fellowship programme (Ishango.ai), at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS). I supervised 14 African students (who have recently completed MSc degrees at AIMS) on real-world data science projects for international companies.

AIMS is a competitive institution in Africa, attracting the strongest students on the continent, and Ishango.ai is then a further filter only accepting the best AIMS students. The two-month programme is coming to an end and the students are now thinking of the next steps.

How could such a study be performed? First, random groups of non-smokers and smokers (without cancer) would have to volunteer themselves (see schematic below). Assume that the percentage of people in each scenario who emerge as cancer patients is found to be 25% from the non-smokers and 50% from the smokers. The study here suggests that the habit of smoking is responsible for two-thirds of lung cancer cases. The 'probability ratio', is a number characterising the change in probability and is given here by the probability of contracting lung cancer as a smoker (with the 'external influence': cigarettes), divided by the probability of contracting lung cancer as a non-smoker (without the 'external influence'). According to this example, the risk of contracting lung cancer if one smokes, doubles (probability ratio = 50%⁄25% = 2). The number of people in each group was kept low for explanatory purposes - the statistics can be resolved accurately when the sample size is large.

The analogy provided above is a fitting one in terms of my work. The resemblances are highlighted in the following table:


<table class="table-bordered">
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<th>The 'altered' scenario: </th>
<td>the smokers</td>
<td>model simulations representing a world with human activity</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>The 'natural' scenario: </th>
<td>the non-smokers</td>
<td>model simulations representing a world without human activity</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>The 'event' we are interested in: </th>
<td>lung cancer</td>
<td>an extreme weather event</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

We can think of what is happening on Earth as an experiment which began roughly 200 years ago at the start of the Industrial Revolution. The current state of the atmosphere has deviated from its natural state just as the state of a smoker’s vital organs is altered from a natural state after being introduced to smoking. If the schematic above were to be remade within the climate context, it would look as follows:

This figure illustrates a popular method carried out by current event attribution in order to approximate human contribution to the chance of weather extremes. The question marks symbolise a primary objective: to establish the probability of occurrence of various weather extremes in both a world with and without anthropogenic emissions. Like in the smoking analogy, a 'probability ratio' can subsequently be calculated.
