I am passionate about data analysis, data visualisation, and pretty much anything that involves technical know-how and logical thinking. My interestes include problem solving, statistics, automation, building unix servers (like the one this website is hosted on), processing data, and exploring / finding patterns in data to make predictions: anything from simple linear regression to more advanced methods (e.g. supervised machine learning). 

My current research investigates how human activity (through our greenhouse-gas emissions) has contributed to the frequency and nature of weather extremes. Answers to these questions can be reached by analysing output from climate models run under a range of climate scenarios forced with specific concentrations of greenhouse gases - some representative of a theoretical world supposing humans had never interfered with the climate system. Solving the problem relies on credible climate model simulations in periods where we have poor observations (e.g. 150 years ago when the climate was "natural"). However, since climate models are imperfect, we use statistical methods to select subsets of models or weight models differently, such that they collectively compare well to observations in-sample. If results are satisfactory after cross-validation (in sample) or model-as-truth experiments (out-of-sample), we then apply our fitted statistical model out-of-sample into unknown territory!

This website live-tracks some climate metrics (check it out [here](tracking-climate-indices.html)), and sometimes I write [blog posts](../).
