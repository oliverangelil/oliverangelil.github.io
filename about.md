I am a PhD candidate in Climate Science at the [Climate Change Research Centre](http://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/ccrc-team/students/nadja-herger) at UNSW in Sydney, Australia. Before that, I completed both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees at ETH Zürich in Environmental Sciences, specialising in Climate Science.

My PhD focuses on combining global climate model output in a way that their interdependency is accounted for. This is done by optimally selecting ensemble members with improved skill in the historical period (in-sample) and also ensuring skill under different forcing conditions (out-of-sample). The optimal subset is then used to better constrain future climate projections (mainly temperature and precipitation fields). Additionally, machine learning tools such as multidimensional scaling (MDS) and clustering are used to better understand the relationship between climate models and observations.

Most of my time is spent analysing and visualising large complex, multi-dimensional datasets on servers using Python, CDO and bash. Interesting findings are written up and published in [scientific journals](publications.md), where they reach an international audience. I am passionate about data science, visualisation as a tool to communicate findings to a broader audience, statistics to discover and explain patterns in data, as well as to make predictions on unseen data.

In my spare time I enjoy [photography](https://500px.com/nadja_herger), ultimate frisbee, sewing, and graphic design.
