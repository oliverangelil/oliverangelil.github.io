Welcome to my website! I am half South African and half Swiss - I grew up in Cape Town, but have been living in Zurich since 2011. I am currently working as a Senior Data Scientist at Credit Suisse. My expertise lies in data analysis, data visualisation, statistical learning, and data engineering; however I am interested in a range of subjects that involve technical know-how and logical thinking. Further interests include deep learning, natural language processing, combinatorial optimization, automation, building and maintaining unix servers, personal finance, and endurance sports. 

<!-- My current research investigates how human activity (through our greenhouse-gas emissions) has contributed to the frequency and nature of weather extremes. Answers to these questions can be reached by analysing output from climate models run under a range of climate scenarios forced with specific concentrations of greenhouse gases - some representative of a theoretical world supposing humans had never interfered with the climate system. Solving the problem relies on credible climate model simulations in periods where we have poor observations (e.g. 150 years ago when the climate was "natural"). However, since climate models are imperfect, we use statistical methods to select subsets of models or weight models differently, such that they collectively compare well to observations in-sample. If results are satisfactory after cross-validation (in sample) or model-as-truth experiments (out-of-sample), we then apply our fitted statistical model out-of-sample into unknown territory! -->

My PhD (undertaken in Sydney, Australia) focused on making predictions of future rainfall and temperature extremes. Since climate models are imperfect, we use statistical methods to select subsets of models or weight models differently, such that they collectively compare well to observations in-sample. If results are satisfactory after cross-validation (in sample) or model-as-truth experiments (out-of-sample), we then apply our fitted statistical model out-of-sample (into the future). 

Up until the end of my PhD I led and co-authored a range of peer-reviewed articles which are published in scientific journals. The full list can be found [here](../publications).
